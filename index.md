title: Clarification Requests in Dialogue Systems
---

**Teachers:** Tatiana Anikina and Natalia Skachkova (DFKI)

**Description:**

This seminar is about **clarification requests**, specifically in dialogue. We will learn about different types of clarification requests, look at the available datasets and evaluation metrics. We will also review some of the recent models for clarification request identification, ranking and generation.

**Organizational info:**

This is a **block seminar** which means that we will have 3 introductory lectures at the beginning of the semester followed by the student presentations at the end of the semester (possibly the first week of March, TBA).
 
Each participant will be asked to give a 30 minutes presentation on one of the papers and provide a short summary and a couple of questions for other papers from the reading list. The seminar also offers an opportunity to earn 7 CP (credit points) if the student submits a term paper after the presentation (only presentation gives 4 CP).

**Sessions:** 

The first sessions will be on Tuesdays from 16:15 until 17:45. The student presentations will be at the end of the winter semester (possibly the first week of March, TBA).
